The package `ivalutils` provides classes for basic interval arithmetics as
well as classes for building sequences of adjacent intervals and for building
mappings of intervals to arbitrary values.

An Interval defines a subset of a set of values by optionally giving a lower
and / or an upper limit.

The base set of values - and therefore the given limits - must have a
common base type which defines a total order on the values.
